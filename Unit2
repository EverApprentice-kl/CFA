#Description: Python Lists

'''
Practice 1
Assume you work as a financial analyst and you decide to list 9 divident-paying companies in the US
in a Python list named "dividend_companies"

dividend_companies = ['Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (ticker: PXD)', 
'Lumen Technologies Inc. (LUMN)', 'Altria Group Inc. (MO)', 
'Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)', 'Devon Energy Corp. (DVN)', 
'AT&T Inc. (T)', 'Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG)', 
'Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)', 'Kinder Morgan Inc. (KMI)']

1. Print first, second and forth elements individually.
2. Print last element using 3 different methods.
3. Print all elements in the list, first 3 elements, and last 3 elements
'''

# first, second and forth elements individually
print(dividend_companies[0])
print(dividend_companies[1])
print(dividend_companies[3])

# print last element
print(dividend_companies[-1])
print(dividend_companies[len(dividend_companies) - 1])

# print first 3 elements and last 3 elements
print(dividend_companies[0:3])
print(dividend_companies[-3:])


'''
Practice 2
Assume that you work as a financial analyst at a pension fund. You decided to list the names of
your 3 top favourite technology stocks along their price in a dictionary.
1. Define the dictionary.
2. Calculate the average stock price listed in the dictionary.
3. Assume that you want to add 2 more stocks to the dictionary, update and calculate the new average
using 2 different methods.
'''

# create initial dictionary
tech_stocks = {"AAPL": 225.2, "NVDA": 126.99, "MSFT": 413.58}

# calculate average stock price
stock_amount = len(tech_stocks)
avg_price = (tech_stocks["AAPL"] + tech_stocks["NVDA"] + tech_stocks["MSFT"]) / stock_amount

# add 2 new stocks
tech_stocks["ORCL"] = 138.68
tech_stocks["CRM"] = 267.05

# calculate new average
avg_price = (tech_stocks["AAPL"] + tech_stocks["NVDA"] + tech_stocks["MSFT"]
             tech_stocks["ORCL"] + tech_stocks["CRM"]) / stock_amount
avg_price

# alternative to calculate average
avg_price = sum(tech_stocks.values()) / len(tech_stocks)
