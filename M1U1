###
Assume that you have $5000 in your brokerage account and you decided to invest the entire amount in
Procter & Gamble (P&G) stock which is trading at $142.5 per share. Complete the following tasks:
1. Write a Python code that defines two variables for the account balance and P&G stock price. 
Feel free to select any valid variable names
2. Confirm variables datatypes
3. Calculate number of shares that you can buy with the available balance in your account
###

# assign variables and confirm datatypes
balance = 5000
stockprice_PG = 142.5
type(acc_balance)
type(stockprice_PG)

# calculate share of PG; use // floor operator to round down result
share_of_PG = balance // stockprice_PG

# alternative: use round
num_shares = balance / stockprice_PG
round(num_shares)
