#Description: Variable Assignment, Math Operations, and Data Types

###
Practice 1
Assume that you have $5000 in your brokerage account and you decided to invest the entire amount in
Procter & Gamble (P&G) stock which is trading at $142.5 per share. Complete the following tasks:
1. Write a Python code that defines two variables for the account balance and P&G stock price. 
Feel free to select any valid variable names
2. Confirm variables datatypes
3. Calculate number of shares that you can buy with the available balance in your account
###

# assign variables and confirm datatypes
balance = 5000
stockprice_PG = 142.5
type(acc_balance)
type(stockprice_PG)

# calculate share of PG; use // floor operator to round down result
share_of_PG = balance // stockprice_PG
# alternative: use round
num_shares = balance / stockprice_PG
round(num_shares)


###
Practice 2
Write a Python code that performs the following tasks:
1. Prints out the following message to the screen:
  "Procter and Gamble (P&G), which reports using US GAAP, sold a piece of land for $500000" 
2. Generalize your code to the company name, reporting standard, and dollar amount
3. Test your code and perform a sanity check
Hint: For task 2, you will need to define three variables for company name, reporting standard, 
and dollar amount and use the format method with the print function.
###

# assign company name, reporting standard, dollar amount
company = "Procter and Gamble (P&G)"
report_std = "US GAAP"
dollar_amount = 500000

# print message
print("{}, which reports using {}, sold a piece of land for ${}" 
  .format(company, report_std, dollar_amount))


###
Practice 3
Assume that you work as a financial analyst and you have been tasked to develop a Python app
that analyzes securities using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).
1. Review CAPM and write down the formula.
2. Code that will receive beta for a given sotck, risk-free rate and expected broad market return
from the user and prints out the expected return on the stock. Round your answer to 2 decimal.
3. Compare your answer to online CAPM calculator.
###

# Gather input
stock = input("Please enter the name of the stock: ")
beta = float(input("Enter the stock beta: "))
risk_free_rate = float(input("Enter the risk-free rate of return in %: ")) / 100
market_return_rate = float(input("Enter the expected broad market rate of return in %: ")) / 100

# Calculate expected return of selected stock using CAPM 
expected_return = beta * (market_return_rate - risk_free_rate) + risk_free_rate

# round expected_return
expected_return = round(expected_return, 2)

# output msg
print("Using the CAPM formula, the expected return on {} stock is {}%" .format(stock, expected_return * 100))
