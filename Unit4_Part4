Assume that you became a new client to the investment firm that has its 
data stored in "investor_df", write a python code that performs the 
following:
1. Define a new Pandas DataFrame named "new_client_df" that contains 
your information such as client ID (choose C1), first name, last name, 
age, portfolio size, years with investment firm, risk tolerance, goal, 
salaries and job title
2. Concatenate this new dataframe to the original Pandas dataframe 
"investor_df"
3. Reset the index
