Using Pandas, complete the following tasks:
1. Import the "investor_data.csv" using Pandas
2. Sort the Pandas DataFrame using the "Age" column from oldest to youngest 
(in a descending order). Make sure to enforce the change to take place 
in memory [External Research is Required].
3. Leverage pandas operations to only select high networth individuals 
with minimum portfolio size of $500,000.
4. What is the combined portfolio size for all customers with networth 
of $500,000+?
