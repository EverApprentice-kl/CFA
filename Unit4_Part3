Description: Practice of dataframe functions
"""
import pandas as pd

"""
Write a Python code that performs the following tasks:
1. Import the "investor_data.csv" dataset and place it in "investors_df" 
DataFrame using Pandas
2. Define a function named "ranking" that receives the portfolio size and 
adds one of the following ranks:
low: client portfolio size is less than $100,000
medium: client portfolio size is between $100,000 and $500,000
high: client portfolio size is more than $500,000
3. Apply the function to the "investor_df" DataFrame and add the output 
to a new column titled "Rank"
"""


# portfolio size ranking function
def ranking(x):
    if x > 500000:
        x = "high"
    elif x < 100000:
        x = "low"
    else:
        x = "medium"
    return x


# --alternative--
def ranking2(x):
    if x < 100000:
        return "low"
    elif x > 100000 and x < 500000:
        return "medium"
    else:
        return "high"


# create dataframe from csv
investors_df = pd.read_csv("investors_data.csv")

# apply size ranking function, add output to a new column titled Rank
investors_df["Rank"] = investors_df["Portfolio Size"].apply(ranking)
print(investors_df)
